          </p>
          <p>
            In this competition, students had to solve DSA, DAA, and algorithm problems on the LeetCode platform. Based on their performance, they were allotted points according to the points system. Students competed in groups, and the rules for group formation had been circulated. The points were recorded in an Excel sheet dedicated to each group, and only the group lead was given access to this sheet. Additionally, the DAA faculty provided a few problem statements from LeetCode, related to topics learned in class, which carried points as well.
          </p>
        
          <!-- Conclusion -->

            Algomania is a long-term coding competition developed to test the algorithmic and coding skills of the participants. It serves as a habit-building competition that encourages students to code regularly over a long interval.
